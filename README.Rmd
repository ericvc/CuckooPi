CuckooPi is a project to create a smart Cuckoo clock, using bird location data from [eBird](https://ebird.org/home) and publicly available sound recordings from [Xeno-canto](https://www.xeno-canto.org/).

Audio recordings of bird songs are played on the hour. Recordings are selected from the changing pool of bird species that are moving through your local area.
